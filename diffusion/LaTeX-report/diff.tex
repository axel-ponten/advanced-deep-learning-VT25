I implemented a diffusion network from the template. I only had time to run 3 epochs due to a conflict of time between start of training and excercise submission deadline. I'm surprised how well it's doing after so short though! However I did acctidentally not use the test set whatsoever... I do not have to time to fix and retrain before deadline.
